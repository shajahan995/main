# Bubble shooter
The goal of the game is to clear the playing field by forming groups of three or more like-colored marbles. The game ends when the balls reach the bottom line of the screen. The more balls destroyed in one shot, the more points scored. A player wins when there are no balls remaining on the playing field.

There are 4 difficulty levels: EasyRide, Novice, Expert, Master. Two scoring modes: Classic, Sniper. The Classic Mode suggests slow-paced gameplay with no time or shots limits. The goal of the Sniper Mode is to clear the playfield using minimum shots.

There are two game modes:

Strategy – Shots limit
Arcade – Time limit
